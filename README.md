# 👋 Hey, I’m Fabrice

I write code.
Then I refactor it.
Then I refactor it again because “future me deserves better.”

I’m a software engineer who’s been around long enough to have strong opinions about semicolons, CI pipelines, and naming things (the hardest problem, obviously).

## 🧠 What I Like Building
⚡ Clean, scalable web apps \
🛠️ Developer tools that remove friction \
🌍 Small side projects that scratch a random itch \
🤖 Automations that save 5 minutes a day (worth it) 

If something can be optimized, scripted, or simplified… I’ll probably try.

## 💻 Current Playground

You’ll find here:
- TypeScript experiments
- Browser extensions
- Utility projects
- Things I built because “why doesn’t this exist already?”

Some projects are serious.
Some are just me having fun.
All of them taught me something.

## 🚀 Stack I Enjoy

TypeScript · JavaScript · Node.js · React · Docker · AWS · CI/CD · Chrome Extensions · Whatever solves the problem without overengineering it


## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy
- Keep it simple.
- Make it readable.
- Automate the boring stuff.
- Ship.
- Improve.
- Repeat.

## ☕ Fun Facts
- ✈️ After living in Ireland 🇮🇪 for several years, I’m happily coding back in France 🇫🇷.  ￼
- ☕ Coffee fuel and well-timed commits keep me going.
- 🛠️ I enjoy building small utilities and extensions that make everyday workflows smoother.
